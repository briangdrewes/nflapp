# Hello! Welcome to my NFL Defensive Scout App

I created this app with RShiny to start a framework for a potential hub of defensive player knowledge to help scouts find & compare players of interest.

Included is a player tracker, team tracker, leaderboard, and live play view. The eventual goal would be to garner interest in the application and ingest real time data of the current season, past season, and college performance for both defensive and offensive players. 

At the moment the application is using weeks 1-9 of the 2022-2023 NFL season as part of the [NFL Big Data Bowl 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2024) on Kaggle.

The attached datasets are derived from the original, if you would like to see the original datasets and wrangling let me know! You can also find the original datasets on the Kaggle link I provided. 

Anyways, here is the application hosted on Shiny: [NFL Tackle Stats Application](https://briangdrewes.shinyapps.io/tacklestatsapp/)
